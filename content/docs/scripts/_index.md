# monome norns scripts

This section contains documentation for scripts I've written for the [monome norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/). 

Right now, I intend only to upkeep two scripts:

- moments: a sort of dancing delay
- movements: a sequencer and sampler (*[in development](https://github.com/airportpeople/movements)*)

Maybe someday, I'll make more ...
