# coding

This section contains documentation for scripts I've written for [monome](https://monome.org) objects. Right now, I am doing my best to upkeep three scripts:

- moments: a sort of dancing delay (for norns)
- movements: a sequencer and sampler (for norns and grid)
- swons: an extension to @tehn's [snows](https://monome.org/docs/iii/library/snows/) (for [iii](https://monome.org/docs/iii/))
