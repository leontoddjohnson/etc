# teaching philosophy

A la [Nancy Chism](https://podnetwork.org/content/uploads/V9-N3-Chism.pdf), I organize my philosophy of teaching into five sections:

1. what is "learning"?
2. what is "teaching"?
3. goals for students
4. implementation and assessment
5. my professional growth

# what is learning

My teaching philosophy is rooted in the idea that ***effective* learning is intrinsically motivated and internally manifested**. In other words, learning is not effective unless it (a) actively sought out by the student, and (b) inextricably tied to the student's inner experience. In my classes, students aren't “receiving” outside knowledge about concepts, but they are discovering it in themselves.[^fn:cognitivist] For this reason, I aim to give students every opportunity to find "their way of understanding" concepts. Indeed, the learning process is a way for students to exert their inner self, and who they are as a person should play a critical part in their learning — this should make the experience interesting and worthwhile for them.

[^fn:cognitivist]: Notably, this perspective aligns with [Cognitive Learning](https://elmlearning.com/hub/learning-theories/cognitive-learning/), which focuses primarily on the deep "sticky" learning that comes with meaning-making, instead of shallow learning which prioritizes memorization.

As an example, I had a struggling student in my math class explain a particular calculus concept by comparing it to the relationship between an airplane's airspeed and its ground speed. Not only was their analogy unique, I had *never* heard it used to describe the concept before in my life. Further, the description he gave was accurate! When a student shares a valid interpretation of a lesson that is completely unique to their own personal experience, then I believe they realize
