# teaching

I'm working on building out this page a bit more ... For now, I'll just share the courses I teach at IUI:

- Intro to Data Science Programming
- Mathematics for Data Science
- Statistics with R
- Data Visualization Design, Evaluation, and Analysis

[Here is my CV](cv_2025.pdf), and I'll share teaching-related blog posts under the "teaching" tag [in my journal](/etc/tags/teaching).
