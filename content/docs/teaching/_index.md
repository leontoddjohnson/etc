# teaching

I teach the following courses at IUI:

- Intro to Data Science Programming
- Mathematics for Data Science
- Statistics with R
- Data Visualization Design, Evaluation, and Analysis

You can find my CV [here](cv_2025.pdf), and teaching-related journal articles [here](/tags/teaching) (use the "teaching" tag). My [teaching philosophy](philosophy) contains my approach to teaching, and I'll share projects/assignment ideas in the [*projects* section](projects).
