# methods

In all of my classes, I employ the following methods:

- Metacognition
- Assignments (and projects)
- Ungrading

Of course, these manifest in different ways depending on the course. For more on the reasoning behind these methods, please see my [teaching philosophy](../philosophy).

Note: The methods in this section are subject to change from semester to semester. I'll try to indicate updates accordingly.

We learn, we continue.
