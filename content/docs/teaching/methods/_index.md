# methods

In *all* of my classes, I employ the following methods:

- metacognition
- assignments (and projects)
- ungrading

For more on these, please see their corresponding page on this website as well as my [teaching philosophy](../philosophy).

Note: The methods in this section are subject to change from semester to semester. I'll try to indicate updates accordingly.

We learn, we continue.

# tools

At Indiana University – Indianapolis, where I teach, we use Canvas as our Learning Management System. Along with this, I use a variety of tools in the courses I teach:

## Programming for Data Science
Tool | Note
-- | --
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) | Weekly labs are hosted on Jupyter notebooks, and students are encouraged to use these to test out code for their projects, or just try out/learn from the code in the weekly notebook.
[Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) | Since the Anaconda distribution gets bloated easily, students build pip environments using Miniconda for this class.
[GitHub](https://github.com/) | Give students real-world experience with version control. This is useful for project group work, weekly exercises, and it's helpful for me and TAs to track *individual* students' progress.
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) | Introduce students to end-to-end development for data science models.
[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) | This allows me to autograde weekly exercises a bit easier. Students turn in their GitHub repositories — each week, they see a new way to incorporate what they learn into the "data science development pipeline".
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) | Right now, this just provides the framework needed for the exercise autograders (e.g., Gradescope). Though, in the future, I intend to incorporate this into the course curriculum[^fn:docker].

[^fn:docker]: Docker is a very widely used tool in the tech industry, and thus an incredibly valuable skill to have as a data scientist. But, from what I can tell, it's often undervalued in higher-ed.

## Mathematics for Data Science
Tool | Note
-- | --
[PlayPosit](https://go.playposit.com/) | Host lecture videos, but also to allow for in-lecture checks for understanding. I use these checks to guide our class meeting review sessions.
[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) | Students use this to learn how to share their mathematical explanations using LaTeX. It also gives them a great introduction to Markdown syntax, which they'll be using a lot in the future. Lastly, it has a nice commenting feature which makes feedback easy for TAs and I.
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) | I use Colab to host Python code that implements the weekly content into something practical. There are usually visualizations students can use to see what's going on.

## Statistics with R
Tool | Note
-- | --
[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) | This is of course the best tool to use when coding in R.
[RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) | Each week, students submit a "Data Dive", where they share some kind of analysis (pertinent to the week's topics) in RPubs, publicly.
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) | I have students use this to publish their own statistical analysis website.

## Data Visualization
Tool | Note
-- | --
[Plotly / Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) | This is one of the most common interactive data visualization tools for Python, and in my opinion, it offers the best mixture of robustness, flexibility, and (coding) accessibility.
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) | In this class, students submit their weekly visualizations in Google Colab. It allows them to render their Dash apps, and it makes it easier for us to evaluate.
[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app) (Public) | Students need experience with this tool, so of course we include it in the curriculum.
[Render](https://render.com/) and GitHub (optional) | For those students with more coding experience, they can publicly host their final interactive data visualization on Render.
