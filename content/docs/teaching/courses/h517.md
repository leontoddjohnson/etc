# data visualization design, analysis, and evaluation 

This class is meant to give students *practical* experience with data visualization tools that they will likely use in future jobs.

## tools

Tool | Note
-- | --
[Plotly / Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) | This is one of the most common interactive data visualization tools for Python, and in my opinion, it offers the best mixture of robustness, flexibility, and (coding) accessibility.
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) | In this class, students submit their weekly visualizations in Google Colab. It allows them to render their Dash apps, and it makes it easier for us to evaluate.
[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app) (Public) | Students need experience with this tool, so of course we include it in the curriculum.
[Render](https://render.com/) and GitHub (optional) | For those students with more coding experience, they can publicly host their final interactive data visualization on Render.
