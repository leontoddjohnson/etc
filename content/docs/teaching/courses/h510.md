This class is meant to be an introduction to inferential statistics, but with a sort of data science bent.

## tools

Tool | Note
-- | --
[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) | This is of course the best tool to use when coding in R.
[RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) | Each week, students submit a "Data Dive", where they share some kind of analysis (pertinent to the week's topics) in RPubs, publicly.
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) | I have students use this to publish their own statistical analysis website.
