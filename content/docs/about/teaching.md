# teaching

I'm working on building out this page a bit more ...

For now, I'll just share the courses I teach at IUI:

- Intro to Data Science Programming
- Mathematics for Data Science
- Statistics with R
- Data Visualization Design, Evaluation, and Analysis

Maybe I'll share my CV here once I get my act together.
